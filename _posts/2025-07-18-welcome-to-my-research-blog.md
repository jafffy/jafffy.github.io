Welcome to my research blog! I'm Jaewon Choi, a Ph.D. candidate at Yonsei University and a researcher at Seoul National University Hospital. This blog will document my journey in developing intelligent systems that bridge computer systems engineering and medical applications.

## What to Expect

This blog will cover topics across my research interests:

### Agentic AI for Healthcare
I'll share insights from my work on autonomous AI agents for clinical decision support, including:
- SNOMED CT mapping automation
- Digital pathology automation
- Clinical workflow optimization

### Mobile Systems & Graphics
Drawing from my experience with LpGL and mobile AR systems:
- Low-power computing techniques
- Real-time rendering optimizations
- Perceptual computing for mobile devices

### Medical AI & Imaging
From my collaborations with medical institutions:
- AI-powered diagnostic systems
- Medical image analysis techniques
- VR/AR applications in healthcare

### Technical Deep Dives
Detailed explorations of:
- System architecture designs
- Algorithm implementations
- Performance optimization strategies

## Recent Highlights

I'm excited to share that our team recently won **first place at the MD Winners Hackathon 2025** with an AI-powered medical diagnosis platform. This achievement demonstrates the potential of agentic AI in transforming healthcare delivery.

## Looking Forward

As I continue my research journey, I'll use this platform to:
- Share technical insights and discoveries
- Document research methodologies
- Discuss challenges and solutions in medical AI
- Connect with fellow researchers and practitioners

Stay tuned for upcoming posts on specific projects, technical tutorials, and research findings. Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaboration or have questions about any of my work.

Let's advance the future of AI in healthcare together!
