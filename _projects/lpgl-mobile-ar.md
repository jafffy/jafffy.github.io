## Project Overview

OpenGL-compatible low-power graphics library designed specifically for mobile AR headsets (Microsoft HoloLens, Magic Leap One) that exploits user perceptual information to reduce power consumption.

## Key Innovation

Leveraging **user perceptual information** such as:
- Head orientation tracking
- Eye tracking data (gaze-aware rendering)
- Attention-based rendering optimization
- User-perception-aware graphics pipeline optimization

## Technical Achievements

- **OpenGL compatibility** - seamless integration with existing applications
- **22% energy reduction** in total system consumption
- **Real-time performance** for interactive AR applications (only ~46Œºs added latency per object)
- **User study validation** with 25 participants showing no significant impact on perceived visual quality
- **Extended battery life** from 3.0 to 3.9 hours on Magic Leap One

## Technical Components

### 1. Gaze- and Head-Aware Rendering
- Leverages gaze and head orientation data to infer user's focal area
- Selectively simplifies or culls objects outside focal region

### 2. Mesh Simplification
- Reduces triangle count for 3D meshes outside core field of view
- Heavy simplification for peripheral/out-of-view objects to save GPU and memory

### 3. Dynamic Frame Rate Control
- Analyzes scene dynamics between frames
- Adjusts frame rate in real-time based on motion/viewpoint changes

### 4. Advanced Culling Techniques
- Beyond standard frustum culling
- Bounding box-based visibility checks for perceptually irrelevant regions

### 5. Reactive Display Complexity Control Engine
- Coordinates mesh simplification, frame rate adjustment, and culling
- Ensures energy efficiency with minimal user-visible degradation
